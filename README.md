## Neural Network (But in Rust, Because Why Not?)

Ever wake up thinking, "Hey, today I'll reinvent neural networks from scratch in Rust!"? No? Well, too late—I did it
already. Welcome to my whimsical Rusty journey into neural network magic, inspired heavily by the
fantastic [NNFS book](https://nnfs.io/) by Harrison Kinsley and Daniel Kukiela.

### Seriously, Read This First

My goals are simple:

- Understand neural networks and machine learning deeply.
- Learn Rust (actually one of my first rust project).

### How to Build

If you're adventurous (or just incredibly bored), you can add this crate directly from GitHub with:

```shell
cargo add --git https://github.com/OffRange/neural_network.git
```

Yes, someone might actually use this. Stranger things have happened.

### Usage

Um, yeah... about that. Still figuring out how the final API will look. Stay tuned or feel free to help out (please?).

### Contributing

Contributions from researchers, practitioners, and enthusiasts are highly encouraged. Constructive criticism,
suggestions, or proposed enhancements are welcome—please open an issue or submit a pull request to facilitate
discussion.

*Happy Rusting!*
